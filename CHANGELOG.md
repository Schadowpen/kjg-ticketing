# v 1.0.0

This version is similar to what was previously installed on the KjG Theater Webserver. Following things were changed
during the migration to a WordPress plugin:

- The data is now stored in an SQL database instead of several JSON files.
- The source code is now completely in english
- Translation support was added
- The width and length of a seat are now stored per seat and not per event
- Tickets are now created on request and not stored in a folder on the server
